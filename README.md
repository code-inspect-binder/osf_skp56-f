# Executable Environment for OSF Project [skp56](https://osf.io/skp56/)

This repository was automatically generated as part of a project to test the reproducibility of open science projects hosted on the Open Science Framework (OSF).

**Project Title:** CSEP 2021: Data Science for the Modern Exercise Physiologist

**Project Description:**
> Data Repository and R scripts for short presentation at CSEP 2021 (Virtual).

CSV files are raw data generated using the R code with 'DataGen' embedded in the name.

R scripts reflect (i) the generation of the data, (ii) batch data handling and working with OSF via the osfr package.

The Rmarkdown script with '_abstract' embedded in the title contains the batch data handling code, but writes to a word template formatted for a conference abstract submission.

The word document with '_template' embedded in the title is generated using a separate Rmarkdown script ("abstract_template" in title). This document is then adjusted in Word to properly format and set document parameters, before being used to write to.

**Important Note:** The contents of the `skp56_src` folder were cloned from the OSF project on **12-03-2025**. Any changes made to the original OSF project after this date will not be reflected in this repository.

The `DESCRIPTION` file was automatically added to make this project Binder-ready. For more information on how R-based OSF projects are containerized, please refer to the `osf-to-binder` GitHub repository: [https://github.com/Code-Inspect/osf-to-binder](https://github.com/Code-Inspect/osf-to-binder)

## flowR Integration

This version of the repository has the **[flowR Addin](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/rstudio-addin-flowr)** preinstalled. flowR allows visual design and execution of data analysis workflows within RStudio, supporting better reproducibility and modular analysis pipelines.

To use flowR, open the project in RStudio and go to `Addins` > `flowR`.

## How to Launch:

**Launch in your Browser:**

ðŸš€ **MyBinder:** [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/code-inspect-binder/osf_skp56-f/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)

   * This will launch the project in an interactive RStudio environment in your web browser.
   * Please note that Binder may take a few minutes to build the environment.

ðŸš€ **NFDI JupyterHub:** [![NFDI](https://nfdi-jupyter.de/images/nfdi_badge.svg)](https://hub.nfdi-jupyter.de/r2d/gh/code-inspect-binder/osf_skp56-f/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)

   * This will launch the project in an interactive RStudio environment on the NFDI JupyterHub platform.

**Access Downloaded Data:**
The downloaded data from the OSF project is located in the `skp56_src` folder.

## Run via Docker for Long-Term Reproducibility

In addition to launching this project using Binder or NFDI JupyterHub, you can reproduce the environment locally using Docker. This is especially useful for long-term access, offline use, or high-performance computing environments.

### Pull the Docker Image

```bash
docker pull meet261/repo2docker-skp56-f:latest
```

### Launch RStudio Server

Run the container (with a name, e.g. `rstudio-dev`):
```bash
docker run -it --name rstudio-dev --platform linux/amd64 -p 8888:8787 --user root meet261/repo2docker-skp56-f bash
```

Inside the container, start RStudio Server with no authentication:
```bash
/usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/rserver --www-port 8787 --auth-none=1
```

Then, open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)

> **Note:** If you're running the container on a remote server (e.g., via SSH), replace `localhost` with your server's IP address.
> For example: `http://<your-server-ip>:8888`
